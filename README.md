# Documentation
This is an umbrella project for various code/tools/utilities I have thought of, or decided to replicate for practice.  Each sub-project/directory will have its own more detailed README to cover its specific contents.
**TODO** Actually create those READMEs.  I'd like them to be reasonably good quality, so this will take time and focus.  It also implies some level of completeness of the piece it documents, which many of these are certainly not.

# Goals
The primary function for this project for me is practice of varying kinds.  It is also a useful collection of 'previous art' for myself that I can pull from when working on other things.  I use this to implement 'normal' things like std::vector, and create new things like units (at the time I came up with the idea and original implementation, I had no idea boost::units existed).  Both things exercise my skill as a programmer and designer in different ways.  Due to the sometimes 'experimental' nature of what I'm working on and thinking about, code quality does not always meet my own standards.  It is my goal that eventually it will, but given the often necessarily WIP nature of many of this code, nothing can be guaranteed.  Improvement changes and ideas are welcome!
